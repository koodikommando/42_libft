A 42 school project to build a custom C library from scratch, reimplementing standard functions such as strlen, strcpy, memset, and more, along with additional functions for handling strings, memory, and linked lists. This foundational project reinforces low-level C programming skills and prepares the library for use in future 42 school projects.
